# NighBirdsSchemaTest
Testing for project schema


You can run the .sql files from the mysql command line or open them in workbench.

run: night_birds_db.sql to create the DB and tables

run: populate_test_data.sql to generate the test data

I have been playing around with query_tests.sql to see how things play.
