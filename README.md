# Clan

Clan is a web application that allows users to interact and connect with members of the community. Users will be able to organize and create events on Clan, as well as share desired details with other members in an effort to promote safety and awareness within the community.

Unlike other community based apps, such as Nextdoor, Clan does not focus on individual's social media statuses. Clan focuses on users creating and posting topics that others within the community can join and contribute to. Users can create and post within various topics such as crime and safety, and organized events such as community meetings or parties.
